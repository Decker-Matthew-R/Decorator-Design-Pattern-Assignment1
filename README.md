A Simple Program to Demonstrate the Decorator Design Pattern: Coded in Java.

The following program is a simple example of the decorator pattern and how it works.. As this is a simple example, it does not allow the user to choose ingredients through a series of options, but rather provides all the decorators and shows how they are used to extend the basic pizza class.  
<br>
You can see that in this program, the DecoratorPizzaProject.java file creates the Pizza interface to group methods that are related to pizza class. The BasicPizza.java file is the building block for which all other decorators are added. In the case of this pizza example, this class is a basic plain pizza. The ToppingAssigner.java file calls the object to be decorated. All other decorator files are used to add functionality and deliciousness to the pizza. Finally, the PizzaGUI.java is what adds all the decorators and prints the results. In a more advanced program, this file would contain the means for a user to pick and choose which decorator class they wanted to add (much like a pizza ordering app you may already use).

Compile and run the PizzaGUI.java file to see the results. Thank you!
